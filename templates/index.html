                    (i) You are given a stock with a value of 10 units and 7 days to sell it. <br>
                    (ii) Each day you are offered a price in the market, and you can choose to sell
                    or not sell your stock. <br>
                    (iii) On the 7th day you are forced to sell the stock no matter the price. <br>
                    <i> Remarks </i>  <br>
                    (i) The prices offered at the market follow are random (uniform) between 0 and 20. <br>
                    (ii) There is another agent playing at the same time, if you both sell the same day
                    you are penalized and only receive half of the price. <br>
                    (iii) Any day you will know if the other agent already sold his stock. Otherwise, bare in
                    mind to try not to choose the same day to sell.
